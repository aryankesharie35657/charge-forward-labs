EV Assistant Web App – Project Overview

Purpose:
A web-based platform that helps electric vehicle (EV) users plan trips, find nearby charging stations, and estimate real-world driving range, with an added EV dataset for vehicle insights.

Main Features:

1. Find Charging Stations

-Displays nearby EV charging stations with real-time availability.

-Shows station name, address, distance, and charging speed type (Standard, Fast, Ultra Fast).

-Includes a “Get Directions” button for easy navigation to each station.


2. Trip Planner
-Lets users plan routes between any two cities or locations.

-Optimizes the route by suggesting charging stops along the journey.

-Displays total distance and a “Plan Route” button for route visualization.


3. Real-World Range Calculator
-Estimates vehicle range based on real-world driving conditions.


Adjustable sliders for:
-Temperature

-Average Speed

-Terrain Difficulty

-Climate Control Usage

-Displays estimated range (in miles) and the percentage of rated range.

-Shows how each factor affects range performance.


4. Electric Vehicle Dataset

-Includes data on various EV models with:

-Vehicle Model Name

-Battery Capacity (kWh)

-Number of Seats

-Enables comparison between models for range, efficiency, and suitability.

-Can be used to integrate personalized trip and range recommendations.

Benefits:

-Provides real-time charging information and optimized travel planning.

-Reduces range anxiety through accurate trip and range prediction.

-Allows users to explore and compare different EV models easily.

-Offers a unified platform for EV journey management and data insights.
